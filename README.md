# Meme generator

This is a pretty silly meme generator that is primarily for understanding useEffects, state, local states, useState, state as props, updating state with props and more. It doesn't work perfectly either since the API call fetches the top 100 memes, so some memes are like multiple panels, rather than a simple one with a text on the top and bottom.

Learnings:
1) useState, useEffect, state as props, child component state updating and other state related things.
